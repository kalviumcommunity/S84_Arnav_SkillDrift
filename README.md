# 🎓 Capstone Project – SkillDrift: A Peer-to-Peer Skill Exchange Platform

⏳ Duration: 3 Weeks

💻 Built For: Lifelong learners, upskillers & passionate sharers 🌍✨

# 🧠 Project Brief: Learn, Teach, Grow—Together.

🚀 SkillDrift is your go-to platform for real-time, peer-powered skill exchange. Whether you're a coding whiz, design guru, guitar enthusiast, or language lover, SkillDrift connects you with people who want to learn what you know—and teach what you don’t.

🌐 The platform enables you to:

- 📜 Create a skill profile listing what you can teach and what you want to learn

- 🤝 Match with peers based on complementary skills & learning goals

- 🗓️ Schedule skill sessions, track progress, and give feedback

- 🧭 Join Skill Circles—small, topic-focused learning groups for accountability and growth

- 🏅 Earn Skill Points & badges for consistency, community contribution, and verified teaching

- 🎥 Bonus: Sessions can be live, recorded, or async—choose your style!

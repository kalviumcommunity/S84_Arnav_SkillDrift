🎓 Capstone Project – FocusGuard: A Distraction-Limiting Study Companion
⏳ Duration: 3 Weeks
 💻 Built For: Students & professionals seeking a deep work zone 🧘‍♂️

🧠 Project Brief: Beat Distractions. Stay in Flow.
🚀 FocusGuard is your ultimate digital productivity companion app—built for those who want to stay focused, get more done, and stress less.
🌑 It launches a dark-themed, minimalist workspace that allows you to access only the essential apps (like VSCode, Chrome, File Manager) and blocks all distractions (such as games, social media, etc.) during your focus session.
🌐 The companion website lets you sign up, log in, download the app, and share thoughts through the community feedback section.
🔒 You’re “locked in” for the session and can only exit with a predefined token or password, helping you build stronger discipline and consistency.
⚠️ Trying to force quit? Not so fast. FocusGuard uses smart tech to prevent unauthorized exits. If you do manage to break out, you’ll lose your streak and forfeit points, keeping you accountable.
